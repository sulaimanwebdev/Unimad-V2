              <div className="mb-16">Unimad is the story of 3 students who went through the dark side of the moon to get a full-time job in the UK. Their journey included an ungodly amount of rejections, recruiters ghosting them, rejections because of visa status, and 1111 other reasons. This also revealed a truth that the barrier to employment was not talent, but the right information. This gave rise to Unimad â€” a platform offering every student the insights needed to dominate their job search, at no cost.</div>

              <div className="mb-16">At Unimad, our mission is to elevate our communityâ€™s profile and story in a way that converts interviews and eventually leads to a job. Our motto is that you should never chase jobs, you should attract them. The best way to do so is to narrate a story that sells. This is exactly the purpose of our 8-week framework and every element of it is crafted with the singular goal of helping you stand out as not just a candidate, but the candidate.</div>
